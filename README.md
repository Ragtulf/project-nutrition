# Project Nutrition

Mission was to build an app which uses barcodes on food packages to retrieve 
the product name and nutritional information. 
Using Redux, preferably using a thunk to wrap our api call.


## The problem

We (Team Ragna & PÃ¥l) started by reading the brief and getting to know the code, and testing the camera to scan barcodes. We didn't get the camera scan to work (using Quagga) so we decided to put that on hold and focus on using an input field for the codes.

We coded in VS code with live share and also used Google Hangout to share our screens. We also used Chrome inspector and Redux Devtools to see and test the result.

If we had more time we would have worked on getting the loading spinner to work and to test even more using the camera scan.

We styled using Styled components.

It was a fun project and we learned a lot, but the camera scan ate up a lot of our time in the beginning of the project.
